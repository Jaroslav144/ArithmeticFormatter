# Arithmetic Formatter

This project I've done as an assignement at Scientific Computing with Python course at https://www.freecodecamp.org.

The program operates via a function that receives a list of strings that are arithmetic problems and returns the problems arranged vertically and side-by-side. The function could optionally take a second argument. When the second argument is set to True, the answers are displayed.
